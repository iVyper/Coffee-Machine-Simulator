# Coffee Machine Simulator
The Coffee Machine is a Python simulation that emulates the functionality of a real-world coffee vending machine. It offers a selection of popular coffee drinks such as espresso, latte, and cappuccino. The program manages ingredient storage, processes coin transactions, calculates change, and updates sales records, all through a user-friendly command-line interface.

## Features

- **Multiple Drink Options:** Choose from espresso, latte, or cappuccino, each with its own ingredient requirements and price.

- **Resource Management:** Checks for sufficient ingredients before processing a purchase and deducts the necessary amounts upon a successful sale.

- **Coin Processing:** Accepts coin inputs (quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies) to calculate the total inserted amount and returns the appropriate change if needed.

- **Reporting Functionality:** Generate a report displaying current storage levels for water, milk, coffee, and total money collected.

- **Interactive Interface:** Use simple text commands to order drinks, check machine status, or turn the machine off.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.x:** Ensure that Python 3 is installed on your system. You can download it from [Python's offical website](python.org).

### How to Run

1. **Download the Code:** Clone the repository or download the `CoffeeMachine.py` file to your computer.

2. **Open Terminal/Command Prompt:** Navigate to the directory containing the file.

3. **Run the program:** Execute the following command:

    ```bash
    python3 CoffeeMachine.py
    ```

4. **Follow the Prompts:**
   - **Order a Drink:** Type espresso, latte, or cappuccino when prompted to purchase a drink.

   - **Check Resources:** Enter report to display the current levels of ingredients and money.

   - **Turn Off the Machine:** Enter off to shut down the simulation.

5. **Coin Input:** If purchasing a drink, follow the prompts to insert coins. The machine will process your coins, calculate change if necessary, and update the internal storage.
